# uiuc_airfoil_exploration
This repo contains an app that can do exploration of the UIUC airfoil database, created during my intern at teTra aviation corp.
The app has also been hosted online on: https://uiuc-airfoil-exploration-by-alfi.onrender.com/. You can also run it locally: `python explore_uiuc_app.py`
